# rtmp_stream 1.0.0

## 📖 Overview
`rtmp_stream` is a Flutter plugin designed to provide unified RTMP streaming and video recording capabilities for **Android** and **iOS**.  
It addresses the lack of suitable Flutter RTMP plugins on pub.dev: existing plugins are either no longer maintained or rely on outdated dependencies, making them unsuitable for modern mobile applications.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Foundation
- **Android**: Based on [`com.github.pedroSG94.RootEncoder:library:2.7.1`](https://github.com/pedroSG94/RootEncoder)  
- **iOS**: Based on [HaishinKit 2.2.5](https://github.com/shogo4405/HaishinKit.swift)  

By leveraging these mature libraries, `rtmp_stream` provides a consistent cross-platform API interface, reducing development complexity.

---

## ❓ Why This Plugin
- No suitable Flutter RTMP plugin exists on pub.dev.  
- Existing plugins suffer from:  
  - Long-term lack of maintenance.  
  - Outdated dependencies, incompatible with the latest Flutter and platform SDKs.  

Therefore, the goal of `rtmp_stream` is to deliver a **modern, stable, and maintainable** RTMP streaming solution.
