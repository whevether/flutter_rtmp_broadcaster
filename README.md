# Flutter RTMP broadcaster

Extend the functionality of the Flutter camera plugin with this plugin. Seamlessly integrate RTMP streaming into your Android and iOS applications, while excluding web platforms.

Utilize a consistent API structure similar to the camera plugin, preserving existing installation requirements. A distinctive feature is the introduction of the `startStreaming(url)` API, enabling developers to initiate real-time streaming to a designated RTMP URL.

This plugin employs established tools:
- Android leverages [rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java](https://github.com/pedroSG94/rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java).
- iOS integration involves [HaishinKit.swift](https://github.com/shogo4405/HaishinKit.swift).

## Features:

- Seamlessly embed live camera previews within widgets
- Capture snapshots, conveniently saving them to files
- Enable video recording capabilities
- Access image streams directly from Dart

## Usage

Using this plugin is as easy as using the original [camera plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/camera), but it extends the controller with more functionalities. You can find here a list of the supported new APIs.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `startVideoStreaming(String url, {int bitrate = 1200 * 1024, bool? androidUseOpenGL})` | Initiates video streaming to an RTMP endpoint. |
| `startVideoRecordingAndStreaming(String filePath, String url, {int bitrate = 1200 * 1024, bool? androidUseOpenGL})` | Initiates video streaming to an RTMP endpoint while simultaneously saving a high-quality version to a local file. |
| `pauseVideoStreaming()` | Pauses an ongoing video stream. |
| `resumeVideoStreaming()` | Resumes a paused video stream. |
| `stopEverything()` | Halts ongoing video streaming and recording processes. |
| ... | ... |

## Getting started

To quickly integrate this plugin into your Flutter project, follow the platform-specific instructions below.

### iOS

To get started on iOS, follow these steps:

1. Open the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
2. Add the following two rows to the `Info.plist` file:
   - Key: `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`
     Value: A description of why your app needs access to the camera.
   - Key: `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`
     Value: A description of why your app needs access to the microphone.

Or in text format add the keys:

```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>App requires access to the camera for live streaming feature.</string>
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>App requires access to the microphone for live streaming feature.</string>
```

### Android

To get started with the **Flutter RTMP Streaming Plugin** on Android, follow these steps:

1. Open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Change the minimum Android SDK version to 21 or higher by modifying the `minSdkVersion` value:
   ```groovy
   minSdkVersion 21
   ```
3. Next, open your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
4. Inside the `android` block, add the following code to the `packagingOptions` section to prevent packaging issues:
   ```groovy
   android {
       // ... other configurations

       packagingOptions {
           exclude 'project.clj'
       }
   }
    ```

These adjustments will ensure compatibility and address packaging concerns for your Android implementation.
